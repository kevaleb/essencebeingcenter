**Testimonials:**
<br>With every session my intention is to let go of everything that is ready and willing to be let go of…Having a water session with Marinna,  I feel intensified that release and allowed not only an emotional and mental release, but a full body physical release as well. I have had a lot of trauma in my life and after one session, I felt like I was able to get rid of a lot of that physical trauma from my body.– Jessica Ewing

“Marinna’s coaching has undoubtedly saved my life and given me back my sanity. I was so alone, I felt crushed and embarrassed to be me. I was so afraid to reach for help but my pain was unbearable. Working with Marinna has allowed me to face into myself and awaken my power. Together we have opened a door in my heart and unlocked my identity, my masculine power, my fearless and kind self. How can I communicate the value of a life? I know that Marinna’s coaching has given me back my life. I could never say enough kind words about her. She gives openly, lovingly, and unconditionally, she has been the greatest healing force of my life, reaching out to her was the most honest and worthwhile thing I have ever done. “   ~ Andrew

“I was blown away at the tools in this book and their ability to transform the way I choose to show up in all of my relationships! This book is an easy reference guide for flipping to the chapter that fits an issue I may be facing and then reminding me of why it has shown up for me. It's an excellent book and I recommend it to everyone, regardless of wether your relationship is great, bad, beyond repair, or you’re not even in a relationship with another person. After all the most important relationship is the one found inside of ourselves.”  ~ Hyrum Nielsen
