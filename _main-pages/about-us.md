<!--<h1>OUR STORY</h1>-->
 
Welcome to the heart of what matters to us at Essence Being Centers. 
We are individual members in a larger community with big heartfelt commitments to being living embodiments of loving consciousness in action for personal greatness and goodness on our beautiful planet earth. We work locally among thousands of families across our globe to facilitate individuals in cultivating Self Sustainability, Sacred Relationships, Prosperity Consciousness and Conscientious Stewardships. 

Our facilitators/mentors practice embodying and promoting wholeness and wellbeing. Each class, service, product is one link in the chain of love and connectedness between mama earth and advanced eternal beings who are forevermore serving us to get where we are capable of in the solar system they provided us with. 
By being a participant with Essence Being Centers you are participating in our mission to create a self sufficient, self sustainable, eco friendly global environmental training field for ourselves and our neighbors to live lives of dignity in peace, health and happiness where ever you choose to call home.


Essence Being Centers vision is to offer irresistible solutions and practices that promote and teach individuals how to BE able vehicles of consciousness on a global scale by mentoring the change we each believe is possible in the world. We intend to inspire, uplift and encourage you through mutual respect and regard each step of the way. We are dedicated to providing safe, nurturing community empowerment environments and settings were you can tap into your deeper inner knowing and potentially be the shift and change we believe is possible. Our experience has been that by taking daily action steps toward fully embodying your life’s greatest purpose to be the best version of who you really already are, you will be able to live closer to the life you always imagined was here available for you!

We imagine our purpose to be facilitators by our own examples of willingness to explore, discover  and self-actualize into being one's full potential through creativity, independence, spontaneity and elemental practices to fully grasp and learn how to embody one's Innate Divine. We believe it is possible to be, do and have health and happiness, that individuals can lead empowered fulfilling lifestyles by practicing life on purpose in conscientious community.
