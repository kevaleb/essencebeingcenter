She returned to the USA at age 30. She divorced and remarried as a second wife in to polygyny. A few years latter went back to school completing her Utah high school education while pregnant with her twelfth child. Through the profound suffering experience polygyny offered, DoriAnn was able to graduate from many unreasonable expectations she had been conditioned in and face a death urge that had plagued her for many years through self-transformational training and a key ingredient has been finding rebirthing breathwork with world renown Leonard Orr. Upon completion of her first training she returned home in 2007 and began rebirthing the 100’s of beloved clients over the last 9 years. DoriAnn has become well known & widespread for the quality results her clients accomplish in their individual ReBirthing Breathwork as well as her training/certification programs.
