**Dedicated for Your Awakening**

My dearest Tristain, Madison, Eric, Lincoln, Brendan, Aiden, Cooper, Milo and all the rest of you who will choose us as your tribe to transmute, transform and transcend along with. as your nana i find this a tender mercy to be on earth at the same time as each of you\! Bless your hearts for choosing to come play with the likes of all of us.

The begining of this new season of my life started with the realization that the institute of marriage according to the dictates of men was not for nana any more. And i claimed this loud and clear for my own sake to not turn on myself and then loose all value and worth, which had been a patern relplayed through out this lifes existence. i came to this understanding while assisting another to reclaim their own value for life. I find it amazing that in sincere service of another, that something greater than ourselves who knows our greatest hearts desires whom are evermore in service with and for us, can fling doors wide open for the sweet sake of our own deliberate intentions\! I dedicate this book to helping you see the possabilitys and choices that await you for your own soverinity. i love you to infinity and beyond forever and a day\!
