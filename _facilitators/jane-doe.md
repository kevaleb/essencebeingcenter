DoriAnn Peck a devoted beloved wife, mother, global sacred Birth Keeper, Certified ReBirthing Breathworker of SEVA (Serenity Eco Villages & Associations), and a Director of Ourherosseva.org a non profit foundation for global aftercare rehabilitation programs.

DoriAnn has been an explorer and an adventurer from the day she choose to be born bum first. Born, raised and graduated from Polygamy (Polygyny) at the young age of 44. She was the oldest child of 17 siblings. She migrated at age 16 to Mexico, where she taught English, provided child and home care for sustenance and a roof over her head. She was married at age 16 and started her first home based business at age 18 baking pies. Her second business was a Home D&eacute;cor business at age 19. Later she worked in Tourism in CanCun and Puerto Vallarta Mexico. After years of raising children she came to realize her deepest interests was birth care and sought out and worked with one of the local favorite midwives a well known Mayan midwife in the Yucatan. During this period she became an integral part helping run a family tropical hardwood carpentry business as well as assisted her then patriarchal husband (they own everything) in growing gardens and goats to provide for their family. She returned to the USA at age 30. She divorced and remarried as a second wife in to polygyny. A few years latter went back to school completing her Utah high school education while pregnant with her twelfth child. Through the profound suffering experience polygyny offered, DoriAnn was able to graduate from many unreasonable expectations she had been conditioned in and face a death urge that had plagued her for many years through self-transformational training and a key ingredient has been finding rebirthing breathwork with world renown Leonard Orr. Upon completion of her first training she returned home in 2007 and began rebirthing the 100’s of beloved clients over the last 9 years. DoriAnn has become well known & widespread for the quality results her clients accomplish in their individual ReBirthing Breathwork as well as her training/certification programs. She inspires her Rebirthee's to go the full distance from cleansing out the old to make room for and discovering each individuals gifts and talents they were born to develop and exponentially master themselves. Healing through ReBirthing Breathwork is simple and yet a profound work that propels the healing and regeneration of the nervous system. Clients learn Life Skills and tools for mastering Self Realization.

She is in ongoing studies with world renown ReBirther Leonard Orr and NAC Oklevueha Medicine Women as well as other medicine people of Indigenous Tribes Globally.
